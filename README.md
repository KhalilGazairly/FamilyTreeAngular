# NgTree

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.0.

## Steps

in `persons-tree.ts` I code my logic to draw the Family Tree Member, I'll Explain it here:
  - first define the jason src, to modifiy it.
  - Mapping on the array , To splite {The Code of members}
  - Then get the numbers of splits codes to collect them into hierarchy array
  - Then Based on The length of code , I arragned it into Tree of arrays 


## The Big Problem I faced

the problem that I had to deal with, Is the Drawing into Template.
I don't like the way that I coded it, because I didn't do it Simple. 
If I have the time, I'll try to code it again by another way.
